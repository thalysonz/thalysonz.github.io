      <description>Exploring mTLS in Mobile Applications Today, I will present a case study on mTLS that I conducted in a private bug bounty program.&#xA;mTLS (Mutual TLS) is a method of mutual authentication that ensures both parties in a network connection are who they claim to be. In an mTLS connection, the server verifies the client&amp;rsquo;s certificate, and the client verifies the server&amp;rsquo;s certificate. If a proxy like Burp Suite were used in this connection, the server would reject the connection.</description>
